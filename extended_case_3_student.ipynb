    "and responsivness were the key elements they noticed. Technical climbing and on the flats, the bike just cruises through the rough. Tight corners and obstacles were handled effortlessly. The fifth tester was more impressed with the smooth ride. The heavy-duty shocks absorbed even the worst bumps and provided a soft ride on all but the \n",
    "nastiest trails and biggest drops. The shifting was rated superb and typical of what we''ve come to expect from Adventure Works Cycles. On descents, the bike handled flawlessly and tracked very well. The bike is well balanced front-to-rear and frame flex was minimal. In particular, the testers\n",
    "noted that the brake system had a unique combination of power and modulation.  While some brake setups can be overly touchy, these brakes had a good\n",

    "do this, the axle will become seated after you tightened the two bottom quick releases, which will then become loose. It''s better to test the tightness carefully or you may notice that the two bottom quick releases have come loose enough to fall completely open.

While the other elements have a negative correlation, meaning that probably these products are less bought when their prices increase. It is also noticeable that there is no correlation for helmets meaning that probably the sold quantity is independent of price."
